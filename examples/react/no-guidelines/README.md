# Components Generated Without Specific Guidelines

This directory contains React components (`Product.tsx`, `ProductList.tsx`,
`Cart.tsx`) and a custom hook (`useCart.ts`) that were generated with minimal,
generic instructions provided to an AI coding assistant. The purpose is to
simulate a scenario where the AI lacks specific project context, coding
standards, or best practice guidelines.

## How These Components Were Generated

The AI was simply asked to create these components with basic functional
requirements, without any explicit instructions regarding:

- Specific component design patterns (e.g., container/presentational).
- Detailed TypeScript typing conventions beyond basic prop interfaces.
- React Hooks best practices (e.g., `useCallback`, `useMemo` for optimization).
- Styling methodology (e.g., Tailwind CSS, CSS Modules).
- Code structure, naming conventions, or documentation standards.

## What You'll Observe (Major Lacks)

Upon reviewing the code in this folder, you'll notice several areas where the
absence of guidelines is apparent:

- **Basic Typing**: While TypeScript is used, the type definitions are often
  minimal and might not be as robust or explicit as they could be for complex
  data structures or callbacks.
- **Inconsistent Styling**: Styling is done using basic inline styles, which is
  not scalable or maintainable for larger applications. There's no consistent
  design system.
- **Lack of Advanced Hook Usage**: Custom hooks might be functional but may not
  leverage advanced React features like `useCallback` or `useMemo` for
  performance optimization, potentially leading to unnecessary re-renders.
- **General Component Structure**: Components are functional but may not
  strictly adhere to principles like Single Responsibility or clear separation
  of concerns.
- **Limited Documentation**: Code comments and JSDoc are sparse or absent,
  making the code harder to understand and maintain for other developers.

This serves as a baseline to demonstrate the impact of providing comprehensive
guidelines to an AI assistant.
