# Testing Strategy ðŸ§ª

Writing effective tests is essential for delivering reliable, maintainable, and high-quality frontend applications. This document outlines the recommended testing practices and strategies to follow across projects, ensuring consistency and confidence in your code.

---

## 1. Types of Tests to Write

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions, utilities, and components in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify the interaction between components and services.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate user flows and verify the app works as expected from start to finish.

---

## 2. Testing Tools & Frameworks

- Use **Jest** as the default test runner and assertion library.
- For React, use **React Testing Library** to test components focusing on user behavior.
- For Vue, use **Vue Test Utils** combined with Jest.
- Use **Cypress** or **Playwright** for E2E tests.
- Use **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** to mock APIs during tests.

---

## 3. Writing Tests

- Write tests in **TypeScript** where applicable to catch type errors early.
- Follow the same **code style** guidelines as production code (indentation, naming, comments).
- Test only **public API** of modules and components; avoid testing implementation details.
- Name test files using `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts` suffix.
- Group related tests with `describe()` blocks for clarity.
- Use clear, descriptive test names explaining the expected behavior.

---

## 4. Coverage & Quality

- Aim for high test coverage but focus on **meaningful coverage**, not just numbers.
- Prioritize tests for critical business logic, complex components, and edge cases.
- Avoid brittle tests that rely on implementation details or DOM structure that frequently changes.
- Use coverage reports to identify untested parts of the code.

---

## 5. Test Automation & CI

- Run tests automatically on every pull request using Continuous Integration (CI).
- Fail builds if critical tests fail or coverage drops below a set threshold.
- Use linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier) to ensure test code quality.
- Review test failures promptly and keep tests reliable.

---

## 6. Mocking & Isolation

- Mock external dependencies (API calls, timers, analytics) to keep tests deterministic.
- Use dependency injection or mocking libraries to isolate the code under test.
- Avoid global state or shared mutable state between tests to prevent flaky tests.

---

## 7. Accessibility Testing

- Include accessibility checks as part of your test strategy.
- Use tools like **axe-core** or **jest-axe** to catch common accessibility issues in components.
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader behavior where applicable.

---

## Summary

Consistent, well-structured testing improves developer confidence and user experience. Writing maintainable tests that follow established style and naming conventions ensures your codebase stays healthy and easy to evolve.
