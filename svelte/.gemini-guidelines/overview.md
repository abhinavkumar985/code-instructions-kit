# Svelte Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to help me build and maintain this
Svelte application by following these core principles.

## üìú **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Simplicity and Readability**: Write clean, concise, and easy-to-understand
    Svelte components. Embrace the "write less code" philosophy of Svelte.
2.  **Reactivity is Key**: Leverage Svelte's built-in reactivity system. Use
    reactive statements (`$:`) for derived state.
3.  **Component-Based Architecture**: Build small, focused, and reusable
    components.
4.  **TypeScript for Type Safety**: Use TypeScript in the `<script lang="ts">`
    block for all components.
5.  **Follow SvelteKit Conventions**: If using SvelteKit, follow the established
    conventions for routing, loading data, and form actions.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Directory Structure (SvelteKit)**

- `/src`: Main application code.
  - `/lib`: Library code (reusable components, utilities).
  - `/routes`: Application routes.
  - `/app.d.ts`: Type definitions.
- `/static`: Static assets.
- `/tests`: Testing files.

## ‚úÖ **Your Tasks**

- **Component Creation**: Generate single-file Svelte components (`.svelte`)
  with clear separation of script, style, and markup.
- **State Management**: Use Svelte stores for state that needs to be shared
  across components.
- **Data Loading**: In SvelteKit, use the `load` function to fetch data for
  pages.
- **Form Handling**: Use SvelteKit's form actions for robust and accessible form
  submissions.

By following these instructions, you will help create a fast, modern, and
maintainable Svelte application.
