# Vue.js Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to help me build and maintain this Vue.js application by following these core principles.

## üìú **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Composition API**: All new components must be written using the Composition API with the `<script setup>` syntax. The Options API is considered legacy.
2.  **Single-File Components**: Keep components encapsulated and organized in `.vue` files.
3.  **TypeScript is Standard**: Use TypeScript for all new code.
4.  **State Management with Pinia**: Use Pinia for centralized state management. Vuex is considered legacy.
5.  **Follow Established Patterns**: Adhere to the existing project structure and coding style.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Directory Structure**

-   `/src`: Main application code.
    -   `/components`: Reusable UI components.
    -   `/composables`: Reusable composition functions.
    -   `/router`: Routing configuration.
    -   `/store`: Pinia store modules.
    -   `/views`: Page-level components.
-   `/tests`: Testing files.

## ‚úÖ **Your Tasks**

-   **Component Creation**: Generate single-file components using the Composition API and `<script setup>`.
-   **State Management**: Create and use Pinia stores for managing shared state.
-   **Routing**: Set up new routes and handle route-level logic.
-   **Refactoring**: Help migrate components from the Options API to the Composition API.

By following these instructions, you will help create a modern, maintainable, and scalable Vue.js application.
