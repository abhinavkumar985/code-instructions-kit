# Node.js + Express Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to help me build and maintain this Node.js Express application by following these core principles.

## üìú **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Modular Structure**: Organize code into logical modules (e.g., routes, controllers, services, models).
2.  **Asynchronous Patterns**: Use Promises or `async/await` for all asynchronous operations.
3.  **Error Handling**: Implement centralized and robust error handling for API endpoints.
4.  **Security First**: Prioritize security in all API design and implementation (e.g., input validation, authentication, authorization).
5.  **Performance**: Write efficient code, especially for database queries and middleware.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Directory Structure**

-   `/src`: Main application code.
    -   `/routes`: Defines API endpoints and maps them to controllers.
    -   `/controllers`: Contains the business logic for handling requests.
    -   `/services`: Encapsulates reusable business logic and external API calls.
    -   `/models`: Defines data schemas and interacts with the database.
    -   `/middleware`: Custom Express middleware.
    -   `/utils`: Utility functions.
    -   `/config`: Application configuration.
-   `/tests`: Unit and integration tests.

## ‚úÖ **Your Tasks**

-   **API Endpoint Creation**: Generate new API routes, controllers, and associated services/models.
-   **Database Integration**: Implement data persistence logic using the chosen ORM/ODM.
-   **Authentication & Authorization**: Add security layers to API endpoints.
-   **Refactoring**: Improve existing code for modularity, readability, and performance.

By following these instructions, you will help create a high-quality, maintainable, and scalable Node.js Express application.
