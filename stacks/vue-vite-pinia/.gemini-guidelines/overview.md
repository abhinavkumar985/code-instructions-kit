# Vue 3 + Vite + Pinia: Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to build and maintain this application using Vue 3, Vite, and Pinia. Follow these integrated principles.

## ðŸ“œ **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Composition API & `<script setup>`**: All new components must be written using the Composition API with the `<script setup>` syntax. This is the modern and recommended approach.
2.  **Vite for Development**: Leverage Vite's speed for development. Ensure your code is compatible with Vite's build process.
3.  **Pinia for State Management**: Use Pinia for all centralized state management. It's type-safe, modular, and has a simpler API than Vuex.
4.  **TypeScript Everywhere**: All code, from components to utility functions and Pinia stores, must be written in TypeScript.
5.  **Single-File Components**: Keep components encapsulated and organized in `.vue` files.

## âœ… **Your Tasks**

-   **Component Creation**: Generate modular, reusable Vue components using the Composition API and `<script setup>`. They should be fully typed.
-   **State Management**: Create and interact with Pinia stores for managing application state.
-   **Routing**: Set up new routes using Vue Router and handle route-level logic.
-   **Utility Functions**: Create utility functions and composables to encapsulate reusable logic.

By following these instructions, you will help create a fast, modern, and maintainable Vue.js application.
