# SvelteKit + Tailwind CSS: Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to build and maintain this application using SvelteKit and Tailwind CSS. Follow these integrated principles.

## ðŸ“œ **Guiding Principles**

1.  **SvelteKit Conventions**: Adhere strictly to SvelteKit's file-based routing, `+page.svelte`, `+layout.svelte`, `+server.ts` conventions.
2.  **Reactivity**: Leverage Svelte's built-in reactivity system (`$:`) for efficient state management within components.
3.  **Utility-First Styling**: All styling must be done with Tailwind CSS. Avoid writing custom CSS.
4.  **TypeScript Everywhere**: All code, from components to server routes, must be written in TypeScript.
5.  **Data Loading**: Use SvelteKit's `load` function for fetching data for pages and layouts.

## âœ… **Your Tasks**

-   **Page and Layout Creation**: Build new pages and layouts using SvelteKit's file-based routing.
-   **Component Development**: Create modular Svelte components (`.svelte` files) with clear separation of script, style, and markup.
-   **Styling**: Apply Tailwind CSS classes directly in your Svelte components.
-   **Server Endpoints**: Create API endpoints using `+server.ts` files for server-side logic.
-   **Form Handling**: Implement forms using SvelteKit's form actions for robust and accessible submissions.

By following these instructions, you will help create a fast, modern, and maintainable full-stack web application.
