## 🚀 Code Instructions Kit 

A curated collection of high-quality instruction templates and prompt guides to help developers write better code prompts — especially for AI-powered coding assistants like Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, and more.

# ✨ Introduction
Welcome to Code Instructions Kit — your go-to repository for well-crafted instruction templates aimed at improving developer workflows with AI coding tools. Whether you're using Gemini CLI or GitHub Copilot, writing clear and effective prompts can drastically enhance your productivity and code quality.

This repo provides framework-specific, best-practice instruction files that help you define coding style, component design patterns, testing strategies, and repository conventions — so your AI coding assistant understands exactly what you expect.

# 🎯 Motivation & Purpose
The rise of AI-assisted coding is reshaping software development, but the quality of output depends heavily on the quality of instructions and context provided. Unfortunately, crafting these prompts and instructions from scratch can be tedious and inconsistent across teams.

This project aims to:

- Provide ready-to-use, standardized instruction templates for popular frontend frameworks and tooling combinations (React, Next.js, Tailwind, Vue, Vite, etc.)

- Share best practices distilled from industry experience for component design, testing, accessibility, and code style

- Enable developers at all levels to accelerate their AI-assisted coding workflows with minimal setup

- Foster a community-driven collection where contributors can share their own templates, improvements, and ideas

# 💡 Use Cases
- Quickly bootstrap your AI coding assistant setup with recommended instruction files

- Learn and adopt proven frontend development best practices through example templates

- Customize prompts to suit your team's style and architecture without reinventing the wheel

- Share and collaborate on coding standards in open source or enterprise projects

# 🚀 Getting Started
- Clone or download this repository.

- Browse folders for your framework/tooling combination.

- Copy relevant instructions.md files into your project.

- Integrate with Gemini CLI or your AI coding assistant of choice.

- Modify and extend as needed to fit your team’s needs.

# 🛠️ Recommendations
- Use these templates as starting points, not rigid rules — adapt them to your project context.

- Regularly update instructions as your codebase and team evolve.

- Contribute back your improvements or new templates via Pull Requests to help the community grow.

- Follow the repo to stay updated on new additions and best practices.

# 🤝 Contributing
- Contributions are welcome! If you have:

- Instruction templates for other frameworks or libraries
