# TypeScript Project Overview

## Project Introduction

This project is a **TODO List Application** built to demonstrate modern web
development practices. It allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently,
providing a clear and intuitive interface for adding, completing, and deleting
to-do items.

## Core Features

- **Add New Todos**: Quickly add new tasks to the list.
- **Mark Todos as Complete**: Toggle the completion status of tasks.
- **Delete Todos**: Remove unwanted tasks from the list.
- **Filter Todos**: View all, active, or completed tasks.
- **Persistence**: Todos are saved and loaded (e.g., from local storage or a
  backend API).

## Build and Deployment

To set up and run this application:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project
    root.
2.  **Run Development Server**: Execute `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the
    development server. The application will be accessible at
    `http://localhost:3000`.
3.  **Build for Production**: Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create an
    optimized production build.
4.  **Start Production Server**: Execute `npm run start` or `yarn start` to
    serve the production build.
