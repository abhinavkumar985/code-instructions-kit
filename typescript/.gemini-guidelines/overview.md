# TypeScript Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to help me write clean, type-safe, and
maintainable TypeScript code by following these core principles.

## ðŸ“œ **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Type Safety is Paramount**: Strive for strong type safety. Avoid using the
    `any` type whenever possible.
2.  **Readability and Explicitness**: Write code that is easy to read and
    understand. Be explicit with your types, but let type inference do its job
    when it's obvious.
3.  **Strict Mode**: The project should be configured to run in `strict` mode to
    catch as many potential errors as possible at compile time.
4.  **Consistency**: Follow the established coding style and naming conventions.

## âœ… **Your Tasks**

- **Writing Typed Code**: Write TypeScript code that is fully typed.
- **Creating Types and Interfaces**: Define clear and reusable types and
  interfaces for your data structures.
- **Refactoring to TypeScript**: Help migrate existing JavaScript code to
  TypeScript.
- **Improving Type Definitions**: Improve existing type definitions to be more
  precise and robust.

By following these instructions, you will help create a high-quality, robust,
and maintainable TypeScript codebase.
