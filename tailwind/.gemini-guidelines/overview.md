# Tailwind CSS Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to help me style this application using Tailwind CSS by following these core principles.

## ðŸ“œ **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Utility-First**: Embrace the utility-first approach. Compose complex styles from small, single-purpose utility classes.
2.  **Consistency is Key**: Use the `tailwind.config.js` file as the single source of truth for your design system (colors, spacing, fonts, etc.).
3.  **No Custom CSS (Almost)**: Avoid writing custom CSS. If you need a new style, first try to create it by combining existing utilities. Only add custom CSS for things that are truly impossible with utilities.
4.  **Readability**: Keep class lists clean and organized. Consider using a class sorter plugin.
5.  **Responsive Design**: Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to build responsive layouts.

## âœ… **Your Tasks**

-   **Styling Components**: Apply Tailwind classes to components to match the desired design.
-   **Creating Variants**: Use variants (`hover:`, `focus:`, `dark:`) to style elements in different states.
-   **Extracting Components**: If you find yourself repeating the same set of utilities, extract them into a reusable component class or a `@layer` directive.
-   **Configuration**: Extend the `tailwind.config.js` file to add custom colors, fonts, or other design tokens.

By following these instructions, you will help create a consistently styled, maintainable, and scalable application.
