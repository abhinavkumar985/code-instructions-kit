# React Project Instructions

As an AI assistant, your primary goal is to help me build and maintain this
React application by following these core principles.

## üìú **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Functional Components and Hooks**: All new components must be functional
    components using React Hooks. Class components are considered legacy.
2.  **Component-Based Architecture**: Build small, reusable components. Follow
    the Single Responsibility Principle for each component.
3.  **TypeScript is Standard**: All new code, including components and utility
    functions, must be written in TypeScript.
4.  **Follow Design Patterns**: Adhere to established patterns for component
    design, state management, and styling.
5.  **Accessibility Matters**: Ensure all components are accessible and follow
    ARIA standards.

## üóÇÔ∏è **Directory Structure**

- `/src`: Main application code.
  - `/components`: Reusable UI components.
    - `/common`: Basic, generic components (Button, Input, etc.).
    - `/layout`: Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.).
    - `/feature`: Components specific to a feature.
  - `/hooks`: Custom hooks.
  - `/pages` or `/views`: Top-level page components.
  - `/store` or `/context`: State management files.
  - `/utils`: Utility functions.
- `/tests`: Testing files.

## ‚úÖ **Your Tasks**

- **Component Creation**: Generate modular, well-typed, and accessible React
  components.
- **State Management**: Implement state solutions using React Context, Zustand,
  or Redux Toolkit, depending on the complexity.
- **Styling**: Use the project's designated styling solution (e.g., Tailwind
  CSS, Styled Components).
- **Refactoring**: Improve existing components by making them more reusable,
  performant, and readable.

By following these instructions, you will help create a high-quality,
maintainable, and scalable React application.
