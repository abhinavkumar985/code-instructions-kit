# Testing Strategy

Follow this testing strategy to ensure the application is reliable and bug-free.

## ðŸ§ª **Tools**

-   **Jest**: For unit testing.
-   **React Testing Library**: For testing components.
-   **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing.

## âœ… **Instructions**

1.  **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for custom Hooks and utility functions.

2.  **Component Tests**: Test React components from the user's perspective. Use React Testing Library to find elements and interact with them.

    ```typescript
    // components/UserProfile.test.tsx
    import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
    import UserProfile from './UserProfile';

    it('should display the user's name', () => {
      const user = { name: 'John Doe' };
      render(<UserProfile user={user} />);
      expect(screen.getByText(/John Doe/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
    ```

3.  **Integration Tests**: Test how multiple components work together. For example, test a form component with its input and button components.

4.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Use Cypress to test critical user flows across the entire application.
